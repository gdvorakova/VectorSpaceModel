# Vector Space Model
This is the assignment of the Information Retrieval (NPFL103) course at
the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University.

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with vector space models, text
preprocessing, system tuning, and experimentation in Information Retrieval.

## Objectives
* Develop an experimental retrieval system based on vector space model.
* Experiment with methods for text processing, query construction, term
    and document weighting, similarity measurement, etc.
* Optimize the system on a test collection and a set of training topics.
* Write a detailed report on your experiments.
* Present your results during the course practicals.
